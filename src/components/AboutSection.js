          <br></br>I graduated from NYU Tandon's Integrated Design & Media
          program in May 2023, but my learning journey hasn't ended. I'm always
          eager to learn new things!
          <br></br>Feel free to chat with me about anything ranging from my
          hobbies (video games! reading! knitting!
